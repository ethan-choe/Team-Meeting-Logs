# Team-Meeting-Logs
A script that summarizes our meetings progress



## Feb 5, 2020

Decided to develop a 2D platformer similar to Celeste with a focus on movement and puzzles. The main mechanic of the game is brainstormed to change based on what the users needs, much like Shulk from super smash bros. After deciding on our project, we began developing milestone 1 and reorgainzing a Team meeting that would work for all of us. Our schedules don't align during the week so we had to compromise with meeting during the weekend.
